[Lets Click and Makeup](http://www.kongregate.com/games/TheCoderMonkey/lets-click-and-makeup) is a point and click game created in Flash over a weekend. I tasked myself with creating a point and click game over two days to see what I could come up with and produce. 

Lets Click and Makeup is set around a man who is late for his hot date, but his door is broken and he has lost his trousers, can you help him figure out a way to get to his date and still look snazzy?
