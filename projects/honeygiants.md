[Honey Giants](http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=8cbe871f8c0d59fab93b) is a small PuzzleScript game I created to learn and experiment with PuzzleScript itself. Honey Giants is about clumsy giants with sticky hands trying to move boulders around in fields, as, of course, they have to keep the fields tidy.

I found PuzzleScript to be a very good engine and language for prototyping grid based puzzle games. You can do an awful lot very quickly, and even create some very complex behaviors.
