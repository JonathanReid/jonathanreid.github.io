[Jazz Manatee](http://aliveis.preloaded.com/static/microjam/JazzManatee/) is a small game created as part of a game jam held at Preloaded. Its a massocore style game where the controls are delibirately frustrating and designed to test the player, but yet keep them playing as the game isnt unfair, just hard.

Players are tasked with playing the piano, using both sides of their keyboard at once. The left half of the keyboard controls the manatees left flipper, while the right side controls the right flipper. However, players cannot press the same key twice in a row, so they must remember what key they have used previously for both hands at once.
