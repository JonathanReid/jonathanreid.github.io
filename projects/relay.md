[Relay](http://jonreid.itch.io/relay) is a game I created for Ludum Dare 34, where it placed in the top 20 games overall. Relay places you as a telegraph operator during WW1, specifically in 1914 in the few days before the famous christmas truce.

You have to tap out morse code using f and j (the theme was two buttons, sorry to the purists out there), sending messages back from the front line, requesting for more troops and more food as things in the trenches get worse and worse.

I personally really like this idea, and I am creating a full version, complete with real life telegraph key for inputs! Expect to see more of this game.
