[Relay](http://jonreid.itch.io/relay) is a game I created for Ludum Dare 34, where it placed in the top 20 games overall. Relay places you as a telegraph operator during WW1, specifically in 1914 in the few days before the famous christmas truce.

You have to tap out morse code using f and j (the theme was two buttons, sorry to the purists out there), sending messages back from the front line, requesting for more troops and more food as things in the trenches get worse and worse.

A big part of this game was to push myself visually, usually I fall back to a certain style, especially in jams, where its very flat, colourful vector art. But I wanted to test myself and create a nice 3d environment as I very rarely, if at all do any 3d modelling. It was hard, but I think it works well with this game, although I know its not the best art work ever, I think this is a good start and something I can really improve on for future games.

I personally really like this idea, and I am creating a full version, complete with real life telegraph key for inputs! Expect to see more of this game.
