[Rugged Rovers](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/online_science/games/rugged-rovers.aspx) is an multiplayer installation game created for the Science Museum, London. The game sets out to inspire teenagers to take a career in enginineering by challenging them to design and test rovers. The player draws a chasis and places wheels before sending their design off to be tested on a martian planet surface. 

The installation also allows players on mobile devices to join in, as players in the museum can connect directly to the exhibit over the museums wifi and use their phone as an extra interface when all the museum provided ones are full.

Rugged Rovers was built with Unity and is on iOS, Android, Web and microsoft surface.
