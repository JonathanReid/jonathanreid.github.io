[SNOMAN](http://www.kongregate.com/games/TheCoderMonkey/snoman) is a game created for Ludum Dare 31. Designed to have purposly hard controls, ala QWOP, you try to get a snowman as far down a field as you can using the keys SNOMAN. 

Admittedly, this game is far too hard to really be played or enjoyed, but it was a fun experiment in creating a small game quickly. I learned a lot about designing hard controls, and that its very easy to take it too far beyond fun self hate into frustration about the game being unfair.
