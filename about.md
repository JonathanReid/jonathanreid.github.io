Hey! This site showcases the work of Jon Reid, a Senior Game Developer working in London UK. Currently working at Scary Beasties, making great games for kids. Previously, I was at Preloaded, where I made a number of educational games such as Rugged Rovers and Superbugs.

I'm primarily a Unity developer, but I also work with HTML5. Pretty much anything I can make a game with, I'll do it.

I've made games for a number of platforms, including:

* Mobile
* Tablet
* Web
* Installations

While making games full time for clients, I've also made a few games for myself at game jams and just for fun! You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jonreid), where I showcase some of my more smaller ideas, or just talk about games I'm playing.
