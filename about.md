Hey! This site showcases the work of Jon Reid, a Senior Game Developer working in London UK. I've worked on a number of client based projects for Preloaded, a games with purpose studio.

I'm primarily a Unity developer, but I've done a few games with Flash too, back when it was cool. I also make Unity tools, its very extendable, and customising a game engine to your needs is pretty great.

I've made games for a number of platforms, including:

* Mobile
* Tablet
* Web
* Installations

While making games for clients at Preloaded, I've also made a few games for myself at game jams and just for fun! You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jonreid), where I showcase some of my more smaller ideas, or just talk about games I'm playing.
